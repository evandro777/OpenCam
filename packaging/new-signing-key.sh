Key $fpr created.

  public  (commit it):   packaging/$public
  private (keep secret): $private

Next:
  1. Store the private key as the GitHub secret FLATPAK_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY:
       gh secret set FLATPAK_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY < $private
     or on the website: repo Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret,
     paste the whole file (BEGIN to END line).
  2. Keep a private backup of $private (password manager), then delete the loose file:  shred -u $private
  3. The other one-time GitHub settings are in RELEASING.md.
